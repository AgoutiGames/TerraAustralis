# TerraAustralis
First proof of concept for the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine) revolving around a jumping Thylacine. The scope of the game originally was quite big and many assets were made though the game ended up as a walking simulator.

Since the "game" uses the old deprecated event system of the RawSalmonEngine it probably would be best to completely start over just keeping all assets that were made.
